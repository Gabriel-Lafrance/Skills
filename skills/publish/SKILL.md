# Publish

**Variants:** [../variants.md](../variants.md) — standalone-only. If flow is requested, use the no-flow message.

**Read:** [doctrine.md](doctrine.md) · [reference.md](reference.md) · **Ask style:** [../asking.md](../asking.md)

Publish only. Never invoke from `/goal`, invent a `publish-flow`, write tracker issues, or implement product work.

## Process

1. Inspect git and stop on unsafe states.
2. Lock change type and ticket.
3. Create or reuse the typed branch, then push unless local-only.
4. Ask whether to draft and publish a PR.
5. Show the full title and body.
6. Create the PR only after approval.

Templates, branch rules, question batches, and failure handling live in the reference and doctrine.
